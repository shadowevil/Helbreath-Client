"Do you know the eggs story?
 
On this world most creatures are cursed.
When they die, they're  bounded to
rebirth ... Forever!
 
Even if they loose some minor propriety
when dying, they most precious belonging
are never found. 
The explanation where discovered by an
Alchemist named GemStone:
 
When the creature dies, a kind of 
"Soul Egg" flies away. This egg will
eventually rebirth the same creature a
few seconds or minutes later. 
But, the most precious belonging of the
creature stays inside this "Egg"... 
Unfortunately all those Egg, are 
invisible! 
 
GemStone cast a global enchantment, and
sometimes, the Egg stays visible. 
 
 
The properties of such Eggs have been
studied. 
 
1- They look very close to Zemstones. 
 
2- They're related in some way to
Zemstone, and if you die with an Egg in
your bag, it will eventually disappear.
 
3- Keep them in your bag, they'll hatch.
Most of them leaving a special item. 
 
4- Your contribution may sometimes
increase your luck at finding
rare items... 
 
5- Bad reputation will impair chances
for a nice hatching...
 
Well, there is still lot of mystery in
those Eggs. 
Will you find some of them?"
